This error occurs when using the Expo `Image` component with a URI that's not properly formatted or accessible.  It often manifests as a blank space where the image should be, and there's no specific error message in the console, making it hard to debug. The underlying cause might be a network issue, a problem with the image URL itself, or an issue with the way the URI is being handled within the application.

```javascript
<Image source={{ uri: 'invalid-image-url' }} style={{ width: 200, height: 200 }} />
```
